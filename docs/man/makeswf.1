.SH NAME
makeswf - actionscript compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B makeswf [OPTIONS] <frame_content> ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B makeswf
is a command line interface to the Ming library actionscript compiler, with support for embedding
prebuilt content.
.PP
\fBframe_content\fR can be either: an ActionScript source file, a bitmap file (png or jpg), or an SWF file.
Non-ActionScript input files are currently only recognized by extension (png, jpg, swf). Files with
other extensions will be assumed to contain ActionScript source code.
.PP
Each \fBframe_content\fR will
be stored in a separate frame of the output.
.PP
ActionScript code is preprocessed using \fBcpp\fR before being compiled,
this allows (among many other things) grouping multiple sourcefiles
into a single frame by using \fB#include\fR directives. (See 
.SM
.B PREPROCESSOR
below.)
.PP
Bitmap or SWF content will be stored in a MovieClip named after the corresponding input filename with
path and extension removed. This allows easy referencing of the content by ActionScript code.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-o\fR <output>
Write SWF file to <output>. Default is ``out.swf''.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR <width>x<height>
Set output frame size.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR <frame_rate>
Set output frame rate (defaults to 12).
.TP
\fB\-v\fR <swfversion>
Set output SWF version (defaults to 6).
.TP
\fB\-c\fR <compression_level>
Set output compression level (defaults to 9).
.TP
\fB\-I\fR <dir>
Add <dir> to the include search path.
The option is passed to the C preprocessor.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR <macro>[=<def>]>
Define <macro>.
The option is passed to the C preprocessor.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR <library.swf>:<sym>[,<sym>]>
Import named symbols from the given SWF file and store them into a
.B __shared_assets
invisible sprite.
The file is not required to be found at compile time, and
no check is performed to ensure symbols are therein defined.
It will be loaded at runtime, so make sure to specify the
correct runtime path to find it.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR 
Print quick help.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR 
Print version and copyright info.
.SH PREPROCESSOR
.B makeswf
invokes the C preprocessor on each of the given source filenames before
compiling them. The preprocessed version is named after the output file
with ".frame#.pp" appended; check this file when looking for line numbers
reported in syntax errors. 
.PP
An __SWF_VERSION__ macro is automatically provided so that
ActionScript code can act differently based on target player; it is set
to the output SWF version (changed with -v).
