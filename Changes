0.09-dev  Sun Sep 23
          - added SWF::Constants (this makes using SWF easier but it 
            changes interface a bit :( Now you need to say, for example:
            
                    use SWF::Constants ':Button';

          - Splitted the SWF.xs - it's now easier to maintain and debug
