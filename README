SWF.pm -- A perl interface for creating SWF files.

ABSTRACT:
---------

This is an auto-loadable interface module for Ming - a library for generating 
SWF ("Flash") format movies.

With this library you can create Flash movies on the fly with Perl.


INSTALLATION:
-------------

Read these instructions all the way through before you start!

1.  Make sure you have downloaded Ming ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/ming ). If
    you haven't compiled Ming, it will be compiled during SWF.pm installation
    process (step 3 below).

2.  Unpack the tar file. (If you are reading this you have probably done this. :-))
    Under Unix type:

    tar xvzf ming-perl-XXX.tar.gz

3.  Compile:

	a.  cd ming-perl-XXX/perl-ext
	b.  perl Makefile.PL
	c.  make
	d.  make test (optional but recommended)
	e.  make install

	During step (b), Makefile.PL will try to find your Ming distribution. 
	If it fails, you will be asked to provide the Ming directory.

	If you want to install SWF into your home directory, replace step (b)
	with:

	b. perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/path/to/your/directory

4.  There are some cgi demos in the examples directory. THE EXAMPLES ARE NOT
    PERLIASH (you can write it more succinctly in Perl). These examples were
    created from PHP examples in the Ming distribution.

5.  After install there is too some (still incomplete) documentation accessible by manpages.
    E.g. type 
		
		man SWF
		or
		man SWF::Shape 

		Hint: The KDE file and web browser Konqueror formats manpages automatic as nice HTML-files.
