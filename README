SWF.pm -- A perl interface for creating SWF files.

ABSTRACT:
---------

This is an auto-loadable interface module for Ming - a library for generating 
SWF ("Flash") format movies.

With this library you can create Flash movies on the fly with Perl.


INSTALLATION:
-------------

Read these instructions all the way through before you start!

1.  Make sure you have downloaded Ming ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/ming ). If
    you haven't compiled Ming, it will be compiled during SWF.pm installation
    process (step 3 below).

2.  Unpack the tar file. (If you are reading this you have probably done this. :-))
    Under Unix type:

    tar xvzf ming-perl-XXX.tar.gz

3.  Compile:

	a.  cd ming-perl-XXX/perl-ext
	b.  perl Makefile.PL
		If you want to install SWF into your home directory, replace type:
        	
		perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/
		
		instead
	c.  make
	d.  make test 
		optional but recommended
	e.  make install

	# deactivated currently:
	#During step (b), Makefile.PL will try to find your Ming distribution. 
	#If it fails, you will be asked to provide the Ming directory.


4.  There are a few cgi demos in the examples directory. For more see the testcases of ming:
	$MINGDIR/test

5.  After install there is too some (still incomplete) documentation accessible by manpages.
	E.g. type 
		man SWF
		or
		man SWF::Shape 

		Hint: The KDE file and web browser Konqueror formats manpages automatic as nice HTML-files.
	
	Further documentation you can find here:
		the doc/ dir of ming distribution.
